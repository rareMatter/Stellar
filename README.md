# StellarUI
## StellarUI is a work in progress.

## A declarative user interface framework for writing once and running everywhere.
### Inspired by and modeled after other recent declarative frameworks such as SwiftUI and React.

## Framework Goals
---
### - Compile for every platform - Desktop, Mobile, Web.
### This is an ambitious goal. Initially, only Apple platforms will be supported.
### - Interoperate with native frameworks. This will allow for needed flexibility as time passes and the project, and its environments, change.
### - Modularity.

## Coding Goals
---
### - Clarity over convention. If a convention is obviously going to be unclear to future programmers - don't use it. However, conventions within StellarUI must be consistent.
### - Stability over speed. The turtoise beats the hare. Features should not be rushed if stability will be at risk. This is a long-term project with long-term goals. Even small instabilities can harm trust.

## Non-goals
---
### - To mirror SwiftUI, even though many aspects will closely resemble, if not mirror, SwiftUI. Other frameworks exist whose goal is to mirror and interoperate with SwiftUI. That is not the case for StellarUI. Instead, the focus should be on noticing pitfalls encountered by SwiftUI (if any) and avoiding them. A natural consequence of this approach will be a delay between SwiftUI features and StellarUI adoption of similar features. 

## Supported Platforms
iOS 15+ is currently the only supported platform. Planned platform support includes macOS 11+, iPadOS 14+, watchOS.
